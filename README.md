# beginner-projects
Starting out coding. This will contain my beginner programs.

Pretty simple really. I am starting with language C. I started with indepth youtube series 
to understand the main components, make some programs here, and will go through a textbook
to hopefully understand how things interact with eachother.

I may do some html & css, and pick up javascript to get the front-end down pat.
